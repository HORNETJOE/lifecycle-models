### Waterfall
   The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow. In which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
    
   ### Advantages
     
   - Simple and easy to understand and use

   - Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.

   - Phases are processed and completed one at a time.

   - Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.

   - Clearly defined stages.

   - Well understood milestones.

   - Easy to arrange tasks.

   - Process and results are well documented.
    
  ### Disadvantage
     
   - No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

   - High amounts of risk and uncertainty.

   - Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.

   - Poor model for long and ongoing projects.

   - Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. So, risk and uncertainty is high with        this process model.
   
   - It is difficult to measure progress within stages.

   - Cannot accommodate changing requirements.

   - Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project.

   - Integration is done as a "big-bang. at the very end, which doesn't allow identifying any technological or business bottleneck or      challenges early.
### Evolutionary
The Evolutionary Model or approach is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to an appraisal

### Advanatges
- This is the only method appropriate for situations where a detailed system specification is unavailable. Effective in rapidly producing small systems, software with short life spans, and developing sub-components of larger systems.

### Disadvantages
- It is difficult to measure progress and produce documentation reflecting every version of the system as it evolves. This paradigm usually results in badly structured programs due to continual code modification. Production of good quality software using this method requires highly skilled and motivated programmers.

### Prototyping
   It refers to the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, for example, incomplete versions of the software program being developed.
    
 ### Advantages
    
   - Reduced time and costs, but this can be a disadvantage if the developer loses time in developing the prototypes.
    
   - Improved and increased user involvement.
    
 ### Disadvantages
    
   - Insufficient analysisÂ· User confusion of prototype and finished system.
    
   - Developer misunderstanding of user objectives.
    
   - Excessive development time of the prototype.
    
   - Expense of implementing prototyping
    
### Spiral
It is combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages of top-down and bottom-up concepts. This model of development combines the features of the prototyping model and the waterfall model. The spiral model is favored for large, expensive, and complicated projects. This model uses many of the same phases as the waterfall model, in essentially the same order, separated by planning, risk assessment, and the building of prototypes and simulations.

#### how risk is managed in the Spiral lifecycle model
The spiral life-cycle is a risk driven model which means that this lifecycle model will be more successful and accurate the higher the risk analyses phase. The risk analyses phase is when the risks are weighed up with the project and see if the outcome is worth the risks. The spiral life-cycle is great at monitoring risks within a project and keeping up to date with them. This can create new opportunities to remove risks and keep note of risks in the future.

### Advanatges
- Estimates (i.e. budget, schedule, etc.) become more realistic as work progressed because important issues are discovered earlier.

- Early involvement of developers.

- Manages risks and develops the system into phases.

### Disadvantages
- High cost and time to reach the final product.

- Needs special skills to evaluate the risks and assumptions.

- Highly customized limiting re-usability.

### Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Rapid-application development (RAD) is both a general term, used to refer to adaptive software development approaches, as well as the name for James Martin's approach to rapid development. In general, RAD approaches to software development put less emphasis on planning and more emphasis on an adaptive process. Prototypes are often used in addition to or sometimes even in place of design specifications.

### Advanatges
- Better quality. By having users interact with evolving prototypes the business functionality from a RAD project can often be much higher than that achieved via a waterfall model. The software can be more usable and has a better chance to focus on business problems that are critical to end users rather than technical problems of interest to developers.

- Risk control. Although much of the literature on RAD focuses on speed and user involvement a critical feature of RAD done correctly is risk mitigation. It's worth remembering that Boehm initially characterized the spiral model as a risk based approach. A RAD approach can focus in early on the key risk factors and adjust to them based on empirical evidence collected in the early part of the process. E.g., the complexity of prototyping some of the most complex parts of the system.

- More projects completed on time and within budget. By focusing on the development of incremental units the chances for catastrophic failures that have dogged large waterfall projects is reduced. In the Waterfall model it was common to come to a realization after six months or more of analysis and development that required a radical rethinking of the entire system. With RAD this kind of information can be discovered and acted upon earlier in the process.

### Disadvantages
- The risk of a new approach. For most IT shops RAD was a new approach that required experienced professionals to rethink the way they worked. Humans are virtually always averse to change and any project undertaken with new tools or methods will be more likely to fail the first time simply due to the requirement for the team to learn.

- Requires time of scarce resources. One thing virtually all approaches to RAD have in common is that there is much more interaction throughout the entire life-cycle between users and developers. In the waterfall model, users would define requirements and then mostly go away as developers created the system. In RAD users are involved from the beginning and through virtually the entire project. This requires that the business is willing to invest the time of application domain experts. The paradox is that the better the expert, the more they are familiar with their domain, the more they are required to actually run the business and it may be difficult to convince their supervisors to invest their time. Without such commitments RAD projects will not succeed.

- Less control. One of the advantages of RAD is that it provides a flexible adaptable process. The ideal is to be able to adapt quickly to both problems and opportunities. There is an inevitable trade-off between flexibility and control, more of one means less of the other. If a project (e.g. life-critical software) values control more than agility RAD is not appropriate.

- Poor design. The focus on prototypes can be taken too far in some cases resulting in a "hack and test" methodology where developers are constantly making minor changes to individual components and ignoring system architecture issues that could result in a better overall design. This can especially be an issue for methodologies such as Martin's that focus so heavily on the user interface of the system.

- Lack of scalability. RAD typically focuses on small to medium-sized project teams. The other issues cited above (less design and control) present special challenges when using a RAD approach for very large scale systems.
