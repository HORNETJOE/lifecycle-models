- Waterfall
    - The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach for certain areas of engineering design.
    ## Advantages
    - Simple and easy to understand and use

    - Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.

    - Phases are processed and completed one at a time.

    - Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.

    - Clearly defined stages.

    - Well understood milestones.

    - Easy to arrange tasks.

    - Process and results are well documented.
- Evolutionary
- Prototyping
    - It refers to the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, for example, incomplete versions of the software program being developed.
    ## Advantages
    - Reduced time and costs, but this can be a disadvantage if the developer loses time in developing the prototypes.
    - Improved and increased user involvement.
- Spiral
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Traditional X Agile
- Formal / Light Formal
