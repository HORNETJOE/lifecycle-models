# lifecycle-models
### Waterfall
   - The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow. In which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
    
     ### Advantages
     
   - Simple and easy to understand and use

   - Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.

   - Phases are processed and completed one at a time.

   - Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.

   - Clearly defined stages.

   - Well understood milestones.

   - Easy to arrange tasks.

   - Process and results are well documented.
    
   Disadvantage
     
   - No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

   - High amounts of risk and uncertainty.

   - Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.

   - Poor model for long and ongoing projects.

   - Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing. So, risk and uncertainty is high with        this process model.
   
   - It is difficult to measure progress within stages.

   - Cannot accommodate changing requirements.

   - Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project.

   - Integration is done as a "big-bang. at the very end, which doesn't allow identifying any technological or business bottleneck or      challenges early.

### Prototyping
   - It refers to the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, for example, incomplete versions of the software program being developed.
    
     Advantages
    
   - Reduced time and costs, but this can be a disadvantage if the developer loses time in developing the prototypes.
    
   - Improved and increased user involvement.
    
   Disadvantages
    
   - Insufficient analysisÂ· User confusion of prototype and finished system.
    
   - Developer misunderstanding of user objectives.
    
   - Excessive development time of the prototype.
    
   - Expense of implementing prototyping
    
### Spiral
- It is combining elements of both design and prototyping-in-stages, in an effort to combine advantages of top-down and bottom-up concepts. This model of development combines the features of the prototyping model and the waterfall model.
